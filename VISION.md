# Vision

## Upload and edit
Users can upload and edit their own songs. They manage their libraries.

Users can save a song to their library, and edit it there.

## Sharing
When joining a room, users can share their libraries, and the room will have a shared library of songs.

Still, not sure about access rights to all songs for everybody, if it will remain illegal, users will share their libraries on their own.
