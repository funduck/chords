Directives: comment, comment\_italic and comment\_box
=====================================================

These directives each introduce a *comment* line, a piece of text that
will be included in the printed output but is not part of the lyrics and
chords. The names of these directives originate from the original
`chord` program, the difference between these directives is the
appearance of the comment text.

Comments can be used to place additional playing instructions in the
song.

comment (short: c)
------------------

A comment that historically was shown with a grey background.

comment\_italic (short: ci)
---------------------------

A comment that historically was shown using an italic typeface.

comment\_box (short: cb)
------------------------

A comment that historically was shown using a box around the text.

highlight
---------

This is an alternative to `comment`.

*Note that de actual appearance of these comments is usually controlled
by the formatting program.*
