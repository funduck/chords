# Chords
This is my pet project that should replace Ultimate Guitar app, AmDm.ru and similar sites with songs and chords.

## Motivation
* I wanted to start a pet project I really care about
* I dont like how Ultimate Guitar app works, it is slow, has ads, and limits me to only a subset of songs
* AmDm.ru has flooded itself with ads and is not usable anymore

Obviously, there are more apps and websites, and my list of references will grow, this is just a starting point.

## Core features
* Search for songs by title or artist or lyrics - and here is the kicker number one - full text search by lyrics
* View songs with chords and lyrics
* Autoscroll with adjustable speed
* Chord diagrams
* Room - join room when you are playing together and your screen will autoscroll to the same position, one can manage scrolling while others are playing
